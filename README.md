# Optimal-Global-Alignment-Algorithm

Hello, welcome to my Optimal Global Alignment Algorithm.

I created this to optimize global alignment of DNA sequences up to 1000bp in length through a dynamic programming algorithm. Additionally, it funcions to mine match/mismatch scores from a user-provided matrix utilizing NumPy and Pandas to determine the sequence score. The algorithm completes in O(n^2) time complexity, and has no errors with alignment or scoring.

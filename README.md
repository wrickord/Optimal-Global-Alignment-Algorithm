# Optimal Global Alignment Algorithm

Optimize global alignment of DNA sequences up to 1000bp in length through a dynamic programming algorithm. Additionally, mine match/mismatch scores from a user-provided matrix utilizing NumPy to determine sequence score. The algorithm completes in O(n^2) time complexity, and has no errors with alignment or scoring.
